Overview

This project involves creating a static webpage that serves as a detail page for a YouTube Aggregated Free Skill Course. The goal was to create a functional mockup with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on user experience, interactivity, and visual design.

Features Implemented:

Course Overview: 
Displays course title, skill level, duration, number of videos, and ratings.
Includes an "Enroll" button for course enrollment simulation.
Video Player:
Embeds a YouTube video player for course content.
Shows course descriptions and AI-generated summaries (simulated).
Video List:
Scrollable list of course videos with details like title, duration, views, and completion status.
Checkbox functionality to mark videos as completed.
Notes and Tools:
Allows users to add, save, and manage notes for each video.
Provides a simple question to test knowledge.
Progress Tracker:
Visual representation of course progress with a progress bar.
Additional Features:
Job seeker tips related to the course topic.
Course rating system using stars.
Leaderboard for gamification (simulated scores and rankings).
Discussion forum for community engagement.
Dark mode toggle for accessibility.
Certificate of completion (download button simulation).

Bonus Points:

Gamification: Implemented a leaderboard to encourage engagement.
Community Engagement: A discussion forum where users can post comments.
Certificate of Completion: A button to simulate certificate download.

Technologies Used:

HTML5 for structure
CSS3 for styling (including responsive design with media queries)
Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity

Design Decisions:

Responsive Design: Ensured the layout adjusts for different screen sizes, primarily focusing on mobile devices.
Color Scheme: Used a light color scheme with dark mode available to accommodate different user preferences.
Interactivity: Added dynamic elements like video switching, note saving, and star rating without backend support.

Assumptions Made:

All data (course details, video information, user notes, etc.) is static or simulated since there's no backend.
AI-generated summaries are placeholders since actual AI processing wasn't feasible for this static webpage.
The certificate download links to a placeholder due to the static nature of the project.

Known Issues:

There's no real persistence of user data like notes or comments; all interactions are simulated.
The leaderboard and comments are pre-populated and do not reflect real user activity.

Installation/Usage:

Simply open the index.html file in a web browser to view the project.
No installation is required as this is a static webpage.

Future Enhancements:

Implement actual backend support for saving user data.
Add more interactive features like real-time video switching or dynamic content generation.
Enhance accessibility by adding ARIA labels and improving keyboard navigation.

Files Included:

index.html - The main HTML file with page structure.
style.css - CSS for styling the page.
script.js - JavaScript for interactive features.
